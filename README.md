**Face Recognition Attendance System**


**Features:**

- **Face Detection:** Utilizes Haarcascade face detection algorithms to accurately detect faces from images and video streams.
  
- **Face Recognition:** Implements pre-trained deep learning models such as OpenCV's Deep Neural Networks for face recognition, enabling accurate recognition of registered individuals.
  
- **Attendance Recording:** Automatically records attendance based on recognized faces, eliminating the need for manual entry and reducing administrative workload.
  
- **User Registration:** Allows administrators to register individuals into the system by capturing their facial features and storing them securely.
  
- **User Interface:** Provides a user-friendly interface for administrators to interact with the system, view attendance records, and manage user profiles.
